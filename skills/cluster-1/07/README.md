### Summary

This task focuses on UART communication over USB, where we built a simple program with 3 modes. To get it working you need to set UART to 0 with TX=1 and RX=3 in Menuconfig, and run the console loop in a separate FreeRTOS task so app_main returns quickly and avoids the task watchdog timeout.
